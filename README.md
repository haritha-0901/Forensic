📌 Project Overview
Preserving Integrity of Forensic Evidence is a Python-based solution that leverages Blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity, immutability, and integrity of digital forensic evidence throughout its lifecycle. This system addresses the crucial need for a tamper-proof and transparent mechanism in handling digital evidence, especially in legal and law enforcement domains.

🔍 Problem Statement
In traditional forensic workflows, digital evidence is susceptible to tampering, unauthorized access, or accidental modifications. Ensuring a verifiable chain of custody and data integrity is essential for maintaining evidentiary value in court proceedings.

✅ Solution
This project utilizes a blockchain ledger to:

Record digital forensic evidence and its metadata securely.

Track every action or modification in a transparent and immutable manner.

Provide a reliable chain of custody for each piece of evidence.

Ensure cryptographic verification of data integrity.

🧠 Key Features
🔐 Immutable Blockchain Ledger – Built-in tamper-proof logging of evidence handling.

🕵 Chain of Custody Tracking – Monitors and records every interaction with evidence.

🧾 Cryptographic Hashing – Ensures original evidence has not been altered.

🐍 Python-Based – Simple and extensible implementation using Python.

📦 Modular Design – Easy to integrate into existing forensic tools or workflows.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Flask (for API or web interface, if applicable)

Hashlib / SHA256

JSON / SQLite (for storage, depending on implementation)
